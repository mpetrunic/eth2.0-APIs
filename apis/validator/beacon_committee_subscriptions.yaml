  summary: Signal beacon node to prepare for a committee subnet
  description: |
    After beacon node receives this request,
    search using discv5 for peers related to this subnet
    and replace current peers with those ones if necessary
    If validator `is_aggregator`, beacon node must:
    - announce subnet topic subscription on gossipsub
    - aggregate attestations received on that subnet

        Slot signature is valid and beacon node has prepared the attestation subnet.

        Note that, we cannot be certain Beacon node will find peers for that subnet for various reasons,"
